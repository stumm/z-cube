-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes:
- The WiShield library now uses a new, more stable TCP/IP stack. The library
  includes a port of the uIP stack.
- Server and client modes supported in the TCP/IP stack.
- The limitation of 446 bytes is removed. Larger sized packets can be
  transmitted and received but will have to be broken down into smaller
  sized chunks which are <= 346 bytes.
- Sample WebServer sketch modified to use the new stack to serve up simple
  webpages
- The stack provides an implementation of the socket interface which can be
  used to transmit or receive data

New features:
- Sample WebClient sketch added which demonstrates the operation of sending
  status updates to a Twitter.com account
- ARP client added to periodically send ARP packets to the AP. This was done
  to prevent certain APs from disconnecting the device due to long periods of
  inactivity

Known issues:
None
